Here are a few *rules of thumb* for sketching in SolidWorks:
* Keep your sketch simple. Simple sketches are easier to edit, and are less likely to develop errors.
* Make use of the origin in your first sketch.
* Create sketch geometry first, add geometric relationships second, and then add your dimensions last. Dimensions can sometimes interfere with the addition of required relations.
* Use geometric relations wherever possible to maintain design intent.
* Add or edit dimensions on the closest/smallest geometry first, then work our way to the outer/larger geometry to prevent geometry overlap.
* Use relations, linked values and equations to reduce the number of independent dimensions needed.
* Take advantage of symmetry. Use **Mirror** or **Dynamic Mirror** sketch tool to mirror sketch elements and add symmetrical relations.
* Be flexible. It may be necessary to change the order in which you are adding dimensions or relations.
* Fix errors as they occur.
