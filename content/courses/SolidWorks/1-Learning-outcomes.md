## Introduction

This lesson introduces 2D sketching, the bais of modeling in SolidWorks.
Sketches are used for all sketched features in SolidWorks including:

* Extrusions
* Revolves
* Sweeps
* Lofts

In this lesson, only extruded features will be covered. The others will be covered in detail in later lessons.

## Learning outcomes

Upon the successful completion of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create a part.
* Insert a new sketch.
* Add sketch geometry
* Establish sketch relations between pieces of geometry.
* Understand the state of the sketch.
* Extrude the sketch into a solid.
