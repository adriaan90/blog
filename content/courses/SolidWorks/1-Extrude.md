## Extrude the geometry
Once the sketch is completed, it can be extruded to create the first feature of the part. There are many options for extruding a sketch including the start and end conditions, draft and depth of extrusion, which will be discussed in more detail in later lessons.
Typically, extrusions take place in the direction normal to the sketch plane.

### How to select the extrude feature
* From the menu: **Insert, Boss/Base, Extrude...**
* On the Features toolbar, choose **Boss/Base**

### Extrusion options
As soon as you select the Extrude feature, the view of the geometry will change to trimetric and a preview of the extrusion will show with the default depth.
Handles (purple arrows) appear that can be used to drag the preview to the desired depth. The handles are colored for the active direction and gray for inactive direction. A **Ruler** will appear when you use the handle to edit the depth of the extrusion.

Different extrusion settings are available for you to choose from to determine the depth of your extrusion. 

Once the feature is completed, the sketch will be absorbed into the {{<hl>}}Extrude1{{</hl>}} feature.
