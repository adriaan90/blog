I teach Mechanical Engineering principles, from using equations of movement to how to design a front suspension for an off-road vehicle using FEA.
I am also a researcher, using the material I teach to solve problems found in coal transporting trains and diesel cars. I tinker with any software package I can get a hold of. I quite enjoy using Matlab, SolidWorks, LaTeX and Excel.
