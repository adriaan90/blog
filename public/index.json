You will always follow the same workflow when creating any part:\n Create part. Sketch geometry. Add relations. Extrude sketch. Repeat\u0026hellip;  Create a part When you first open up SolidWorks, a window will appear prompting you to create a new SolidWorks document. This can either be a part, assembly or drawing. If this window does not appear, you can create a new part by selecting: File, New from the main menu.\n Always remember to save your part files frequently. Try and save it as soon as you have created a new document.\n What is sketching in SolidWorks? Sketching is the act of creating a 2D profile comprised of a wireframe geometry. Typical geometry include:\n Lines Arcs Circles Ellipses  Creating a sketch To create a sketch, you must choose a plane on which to sketch. The system provides three initial planes by default. They are:\n Front plane Top plane Right plane   It is important to choose the correct plane to start your sketch on as this choice can influence how your drawing of the part is going to be layed out.\n When creating a new sketch, Insert Sketch opens up the sketcher on the selected plane. If you have not selected a plane when you insert a sketch, SolidWorks will ask you to select the plane on which you want to sketch on.\nActive sketch environment When you have selected a plane to sketch on, the selected plane will rotate so it is parallel to the screen. This only happens for the first sketch of the part. You will see two red arrows originating from the same point, one pointing upwards and the other points right. It represents the sketch origin.\nConfirmation corner When any SolidWorks commands are active, a symbol or a set of symbols appears in the upper right corner of the graphics area. This is called the confirmation corner. When a sketch is opened, the confirmation corner displays two symbols. One looks like the sketch symbol and the other is a red X. These symbols provide a visual reminder that you are active in a sketch.\n Clicking the sketch symbol exists the sketch and save any changes.\n  Clicking the red X exits the sketch and discards any changes.\n When other commands are active, the confirmation corner displays a green check mark and a red X. The check mark executes the current command and the X cancels the command.\nSketch entities SolidWorks offers a vaiety of sketch tools for creating profile geometry. The line tool will be used most of the time. Other sketch entities include:\n Circle Arcs Ellipse Partial ellipse Parabola Spline Arc slots Polygon Rectangle Point Centerline  Basic sketching There are two techniques to sketch a geometry:\nClick-Click Position the cursor where you want the line to start. Click the left mouse button. Move the cursor to where you want the ine to end. A preview of the sketch entity will follow the cursor. Cick the left mouse bitton a second time.\nClick-Drag Position the cursor where you want the line to start. Press and hold the left mouse button. Drag the cursor to where you want the sketch entity to end. A preview of the sketch entity will follow the the cursor. Release the left mouse button.\nSketching a line Sketch a line by selecting the line tool. Click on the origin and move your mouse horizontally to the right. A preview of the line will appear. Click again to end the line.\nDo not be too concerned with making the line the exact length you want it to be at the start when you create the sketch. Your sketch only need to be the approximate size of your final sketch. The dimensioning tool will be used later to make the size exact.\nNext, starting at the end of the horizontal line, sketch a line at an angle.\nInference lines Dashed inference lines appear when drawing lines to help you \u0026lsquo;line-up\u0026rsquo; with existing geometry. These lines include existing line vecotrs, normals, horizontals, veritcals, tangents and centers.\nNote that some lines capture actual geometric relations, while other simply act as a guide or reference when sketching.\nA difference in the color of the inference lines will distinguish them.\nIn the picture below, the line labeled \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; are olive-green and if the sketch line snaps to them, will capture either a tangent or perpendicuar relationship.\nThe line labeled \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; is blue. It only provides a reference, in this case verical, to the other endpoint. If the sketch line is ended at this point, no vertical relation will be captured.\nSketch feedback The sketcher has many feedback features. The cursor will change to show what tipes of entity is being created. It will also indicate what selections on the existing geometry, such as end, coincident or midpoint, are available using a red dot when the cursor is on it.\nThe most three common feedback symbols are:\n  Endpoints: Yellow concentric circles appear at the Endpoint when the cursor is over it.\n  Midpoint: The midpoint appears as a square. It changes to red when the cursor is over the line.\n  Coincident: The quadrant points of the circle appear with a concentric circle over the centerpoint.\n  Closing the sketch Close the sketch with a fina line connected to the starting point of the first line.\n When you want to turn off a sketching tool, you can either press the Esc key, click the line tool a second time, or right-click and the graphics area and choose Select.\n ","date":1581811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581811200,"objectID":"3611bd1e8bffee7f2aba4579e72ec0a9","permalink":"/courses/solidworks/1-creata-a-part/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/solidworks/1-creata-a-part/","section":"courses","summary":"Stages in the sketch process Every sketch has several characteristics that contribute to its shape, size and orientation.

The status of a sketch depends on geometric relations between geometry and the dimensions that define it. The three most common states are:\n Under defined: There is inadequate definition of the sketch, but the sketch can still be used to create features. This is acceptable as most of the time during the initial stages of design, there is not enough information to fully define the sketch. Under defined geometry is blue. Fully defined: The sketch has complete information. Fully defined geometry is black. A general rule is that when a part is released for manufacturing, the sketches within it should be fully defined. Over defined: The sketch has duplicate dimensions or conflicting relations and it should not be used until repaired. Extra dimensions and relations should be deleted. Over defined geometry is red.  Check under defined sketch geometry Check sketch status A sketch is Under defined because some of the geometry is blue. Note that endpoints of a line can be a different color and different state than the line itself.\nFor example, a vertical line from the origin is black because it is:\n Vertical Attached to the origin  However, the uppermost endpoint is blue because the length of the line is under defined.\nDragging Under defined geometry can be dragged to new locations or its size changed. Fully defined geometry cannot. You can determine how the geometry is under defined by dragging the blue parts of the geometry. The lines will either move or increase/decrease in length. This will give you an indication that you need to define the length of the line or need to define the location of the line.\nDesign intent The design intent governs how the part is built and how it will change. In a sketch, design intent is controlled by a combination of two things:\n Sketch relations: Create geometric relationships such as parallel, collinear, perpendicular, or coincident between sketch elements. Dimensions: Dimensions are used to define the size and location of the sketch geometry. Linear, radial, diameter and angular dimensions can be added.  To fully define a sketch and capture the desired design intent requires understanding and applying a combination of relations and dimensions.\nSketch relations Sketch relations are used to force a behaviour on a sketch element thereby capturing design intent. Some relations are added automatically when you create the initial sketch and others can be added later manually.\nYou can check the existing relations by either:\n Symbols appear next to the geometry to indicate what relations are associate with that entity.

You can also right click on the relation icon and selecting the delete option.\n Examples of sketch relations There are many different sketch relations.

As such, our aim is to reduce NOx emissions being produced by the CI engine, and Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) is seen as a viable option.\nLTC is a broad term used generally for combustion techniques where the overall peak combustion temperature is reduced. This is beneficial as it reduces the formation of NOx exhaust gasses. LTC techniques include HCCI, PCCI and RCCI. Although NOx emissions is reduced as a result of lower temperatures, other emissions such as CO emissions and HC emissions can increase due to incomplete combustion.\nThere is thus a balance that needs to be optimised to ensure an overall reduction of all emissions. This research focussed on achieving emissions reduction by optimising EGR and the engine’s fuel delivery.\nFor this research we looked at four parameters that can be used to achieve LTC and ultimately reduce NOx and CO emissions. NOx emissions is reduced by reducing the combustion temperature and CO emissions are reduced by increasing the homogeneity of the air fuel mixture. The table shown in the slide shows the effects on the combustion temperature and the homogeneity of the air fuel mixture as reported in the literature.\nIf we increase pilot injection duration, then the homogeneity of the charge increases as more fuel is being introduced in the pilot injection and thus more of the fuel can mix with the air before combustion occurs. Premixed combustion also increases as a result of this, ultimately increasing the combustion temperature.\nIf we advance the pilot injection start of injection (SOI), then the homogeneity of the charge is increased, as there is more time for the fuel to mix with the air before combustion occurs. Increased homogeneity also increases the premixed combustion, which increases the combustion temperature.\nIf we advance the main injection SOI, then the time for the fuel to mix with the air is decreased, which reduces the homogeneity of the charge as well as the combustion temperature.\nIf we increase the Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) percentage, then the homogeneity of the charge is increased, as more EGR increases the ignition delay and gives the fuel more time to mix with the air. It also reduces the combustion temperature as more inert gasses are introduced into the inlet charge, which absorbs a lot of the heat.\nFrom this table, it can be seen that the four parameters have different effects on combustion temperature and charge homogeneity. It is thus necessary to determine which parameter has a significant effect on emissions formation and which parameter has a lesser effect.\nThe Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool was used to determine the effect of each parameter on the formation of engine emissions and if it is significant or not. A DoE was also used to determine the impact of each parameter as well as determine an optimised point that resulted in overall reduced emissions.\nNext we need to consider the drive cycle that will be used in the simulation. When we look at how past research has generated experimental emissions data, the majority of research found have used steady state engine operating points in their test methodology. The results from steady state experimentation cannot accurately represent real life scenarios. A transient drive cycle is needed to generate results that are comparable to real life. The WLTP was used in this research. It replaced the NEDC that has been used in the past to test the new vehicle entering the market.\nI have created this figure to further illustrate the benefits of using the WLTP for real world emissions investigation. The graph shows the WLTP, in grey circles, as a function of engine speed and BMEP. The red crosses indicate the steady state points used by past research to investigate engine emissions. When looking at the graph, clear gaps are evident in the engine operating map that is not covered by the research considered. The use of a transient drive cycle is thus appropriate if the results needed to be comparable to a real world scenario.\nMethodology\rAn engine simulation was used to investigate the effects of varying the different engine operating parameters on engine emissions. A 2.4 L turbocharged CI engine was simulated. The simulation’s combustion model was validated using in-cylinder pressure data and emissions data was used to validate its emissions models.\nThe Wiebe combustion model was used in this research. Linear regression models was generated for the start of combustion crank angle degree (CAD), premixed fuel mass fraction burned and Wiebe exponent by using the cylinder pressure data. This is necessary as we are simulating a transient drive cycle as well as changing engine parameters that influence combustion.\rThe emission models were validated using exhaust gas analyser experimental data. The engine simulation can only simulate CO emissions and NOx emissions.\nAfter the models were calibrated, it was compared to experimental data to check its accuracy. Here two cylinder pressure graphs are shown; one at 25% load and 1500rpm and the other at 75% load and 3000rpm. The experimental data is shown in a solid line and the simulated model is shown in dashed lines. As can be seen, the simulated results correlate well with the experimental data.\nSame can be said of the simulated emissions. The simulated emission results for the CO emissions and NOx emissions correlate well with the experimental data. We thus have confidence in our simulation and can now move on to setting up the DoE.\nWhen setting up the factorial design, a 2^4 factorial design was chosen as there are 4 parameters that will be investigated. These are EGR percentage, pilot injection duration and main and pilot injection SOI. The test engine is using an aftermarket ECU, which have operating maps loaded onto it by default. These operating maps are used as the starting point for the DoE. The EGR percentage map is in the form of an island with maximum EGR at approximately 2500 rpm and 10 % throttle position. Here is an example of an EGR map with 47% as the maximum percentage. The value as given by the DoE will always be the maximum value and the maps will be scaled according to the maximum value.\nShown here is a table with the low and high values of the first factorial design.\rThe EGR percentage has a low and high value of 0 % and 10 %, pilot injection and main injection SOI is advanced by one CAD and retarded by 1 CAD. The pilot injection duration is decreased by 100 μs and increased by 100 μs. Similar tables were created for the second and third factorial designs based on the results from the previous factorial design.\nIn order to determine the configuration that will reduce emissions the most, we opted to follow the path of greatest emission reduction using multiple factorial designs. After each factorial design, The desirability function was used to determine the best configuration of the parameters under investigation. This then was used to set up the next factorial design. This can be explained in the figure shown.\nThe figure shows the three factorial designs for two parameters, pilot injection SOI and EGR percentage. As can be seen for the first factorial design, the EGR is varied from 0 % to 10 % and the pilot injection SOI is advanced and retarded by 1 CAD. Once the first factorial design is completed, the desirability function is used to determine which configuration reduces the emissions the most. In this case it is an EGR percentage of 10 % and by retarding the pilot injection SOI by 1 CAD. The low and high values of the second factorial design can now be determined with the use of the two equations shown on the slide.\nAs a maximum desirability (Di) is achieved at 10 % EGR, the second factorial design’s low value becomes 10 % and the high level value for the second factorial design becomes 25 %. For the pilot injection SOI, the second factorial design’s low value is set to retard the map by 1 CAD and the high values is set to retard the operating map by 4 CADs.\nOnce the second factorial design is finished, the desirability function is used again to determine which configuration results in the reducing the emissions the most. This results in a EGR percentage of 25 % and retarding the pilot injection SOI by 2 CADs. As such the low and high values for the EGR percentage for the third factorial design is calculated as 25 % and 47.5%. The pilot injection SOI low and high values for the third factorial design stays at retarding the maps with 1 CAD and 4 CADs.\n\rResults and discussion\rShown on this slide is the desirability function plot for the third factorial design that was simulated. As can be seen, by the third factorial design, the start of injection for the pilot and main injection and the injection duration of the pilot injection does not significantly influence the emissions. This can be seen by the almost horizontal lines of the graph.\nThe EGR percentage has a significant effect on the NOx emissions and CO emissions as the graph lines have a steep gradient. The desirability function plot at the top in the form of a half circle indicate that the maximum desirability value will be reached for an EGR percentage at approximately 36 %.\nWhen we put all the factorial designs’ results on one graph, we can get a better overall picture.\rFor the second factorial design, we optimised towards a maximum of CO emissions as per the Euro 4 limits. This resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% of NOx when we use a maximum of 12% EGR.\nTo further investigate LTC, for the third factorial design, we opted to continue to increase the EGR percentage to 47.5%. This resulted in a reduction in NOx of 85% to 0.55g/km where the Euro 4 limit is 0.25g/km. The CO emissions greatly increased as a result of the EGR percentage increasing, to 22.58g/km.\nNext we wanted to see if we achieved LTC. This graph shows the peak temperature for combustion with no LTC techniques used as well as for the combustion temperature for the third factorial design. The difference in peak temperature between the two graphs is approximately 100 °K.\n\rConclusions\r\rNOx emissions were reduced by approximately 85% with an EGR percentage of 47.5 %, retarding the pilot injection and main injection SOI by 1 CAD and increasing the pilot injection duration by 200 μs.\rNOx emissions reduced by approximately 20 % with the use of 12 % EGR without exceeding the Euro 4 CO emissions limit.\rLow temperature combustion was achieved\rThe method of using DoE to minimise engine out emissions was successful\r\r\rLimitations\r\rThe sample size of the experimental data is modest. By using more experimental data, more robust regression models can be constructed.\rA blind transient comparison between simulation and experimental results would be beneficial and increase our confidence in our engine simulation.\rFollowing the path of greatest emission reduction, was successful, but it can result in finding a local minimum, where we want to determine the global minimum.\rThe DoE can be improved by investigate the whole operating map of the engine to ensure that we will be able to determine the global minimum.\r\r\r","date":1566777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566777600,"objectID":"906bf531dd72ae63757a9a7529588244","permalink":"/post/jsae_conference/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/jsae_conference/","section":"post","summary":"NOx emissions have become a health concern in cities with calls to reduce and ban vehicles with CI engines from entering the city. As such, our aim is to reduce NOx emissions being produced by the CI engine, and Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) is seen as a viable option.\nLTC is a broad term used generally for combustion techniques where the overall peak combustion temperature is reduced. This is beneficial as it reduces the formation of NOx exhaust gasses.","tags":[],"title":"JSAE/SAE conference in Kyoto, Japan","type":"post"},{"authors":["Adriaan van Niekerk"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
